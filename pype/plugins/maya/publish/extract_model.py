    Only extracts contents based on the original "setMembers" data to ensure
    publishing the least amount of required shapes. From that it only takes
    the shapes that are not intermediateObjects

    During export it sets a temporary context to perform a clean extraction.
    The context ensures:
        - Smooth preview is turned off for the geometry
        - Default shader is assigned (no materials are exported)
        - Remove display layers
